Sploit1 was a standard buffer overflow attack. The target uses strcpy to copy user input
to the buffer of size 220. Strcpy doesn't check the length of user input so we can 
overwrite stack variables. 

We create a buffer of size 220+8 = 228 and fill with NOPs (0x90) and our shellcode. We then
overwrite the EIP to point back into our buffer in the NOP region, using strncpy(buffer + 224, "\xac\xfc\xff\xbf", 4).
We found this value through GDB as the address of buf in Target1.c's foo() method.
